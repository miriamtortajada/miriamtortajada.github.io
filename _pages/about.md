Hi! I am Miriam Tortajada, a PhD candidate from the University of Murcia (Spain). My research field is Cognitive Neuroscience, specifically memory and attention. During my PhD, I have focused on studying working memory related processes, mostly using electrophysiological methods. During this time, I have learned about EEG analysis techniques (MVPA and oscillations), which is one of the parts that I enjoy the most and I'm always open to work in new projects that require learning new methods.

I have also collaborated in several works related to different attentional states, such as vigilance or mind-wandering.

I'm also very enthusiastic about open science and implementing research practices that could improve the reproducibility of our research.
