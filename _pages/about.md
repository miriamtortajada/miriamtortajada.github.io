Hi! I'm Miriam Tortajada, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Granada, working on the [CONNECTS](https://sites.google.com/view/connects-site/about-connects?authuser=0) project. I got my PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Murcia (Spain). My research field is Cognitive Neuroscience, specifically memory and attention. During my PhD, I focused on studying working memory related processes, mostly using electrophysiological methods. During this time, I have learned about EEG analysis techniques (MVPA and oscillations), which is one of the parts that I enjoy the most and I'm always open to work in new projects that require learning new methods.

I've also collaborated in several works related to different attentional states, such as vigilance or mind-wandering.

I'm also very enthusiastic about open science and implementing research practices that could improve the reproducibility of our research.
